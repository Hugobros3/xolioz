# XolioZ - DayZ Clone for Chunk Stories

XolioZ is a gamemode for Chunk Stories implementing a DayZ-esque zombie survival setting. It is a legacy project, going back all the way to 2012 where it started as a [Minecraft custom server](http://z.xol.io). This codebase is based on the 2014 rewrite as a Bukkit plugin, then ported to Chunk Stories. The code is still not perfect but has been cleaned up and fully translated to English. It serves as a demonstration and PoC of the feasibility of porting content over to Chunk Stories, but also goes further and looks to become a proper, fun game to play by itself.

It adds quite a lot of content and features, in particular :

 * New guns and ammo types, including multiple grenade types and explosives
 * New melee weapons such as crowbars and baseball bats
 * New food types and other items in general
 * Flashlight and batteries
 * Loot spawning with different categories and automatic regeneration
 * Customized Player and Zombies spawns
 * Various tools such as walkie-talkies
 * (wip) Random events such as helicopter crashes
 * Player statistics, including deaths and killcount and survival time

It also comes with a few custom-made maps (not included in the Git repo) ported over from the Minecraft legacy versions, these also come with loot placement files.
